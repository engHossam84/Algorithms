Quick Sort I Runtime: 0 (n log (n)) average, 0 (n2) worst case. Memory: 0 (log (n) ) .
In quick sort, we pick a random element and partition the array, such that all numbers that are less than the
partitioning element come before all elements that are greater than it. The partitioning can be performed
efficiently through a series of swaps (see below).
