Selection Sort I Runtime: O( n2) average and worst case. Memory: 0 (1) .
Selection sort is the child's algorithm: simple, but inefficient. Find the smallest element using a linear scan
and move it to the front (swapping it with the front element). Then, find the second smallest and move it,
again doing a linear scan. Continue doing this until all the elements are in place.
