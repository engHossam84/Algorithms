Merge Sort I Runtime: O( n log (n) ) average and worst case. Memory: Depends.
Merge sort divides the array in half, sorts each of those halves, and then merges them back together. Each
of those halves has the same sorting algorithm applied to it. Eventually, you are merging just two singleelement
arrays. It is the "merge" part that does all the heavy lifting.
